# RDPot-of-honey
This provides a tool for logging and blocking IPs that attempt to connect to a RDP honey pot hosted in AWS using NACLs. The tool includes a script for automating deployment and logging configuration, and provides an effective way to monitor and secure RDP honey pots in AWS.

## ToDo

 - Get it to work
 - Move from SQL to CloudWatch/Splunk for logs
